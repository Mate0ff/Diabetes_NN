# Diabetes Binary Classification Neural Network

## Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort of my and my colleagues for our classes to develop a neural network model capable of predicting the presence of diabetes in patients. Utilizing a well-curated diabetes dataset, our model performs binary classification to determine whether individuals are likely to have diabetes based on various medical factors.

## Dataset
The dataset includes medical records and diagnostic measurements from patients, with the target variable indicating the presence of diabetes. The data has been split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the neural network model.

## Neural Network Model
The neural network was designed with multiple layers and neurons to process the input data. Activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers were carefully selected to aid in the model's convergence and improve predictive accuracy.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing included normalization and handling of missing values.
- The neural network structure consists of an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer with a binary classification.
- Training involved adjusting weights using backpropagation.
